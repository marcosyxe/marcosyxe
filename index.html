          <h2 class="neoTitle">Neopreno immersive trip</h2>

          <ol class="neoStory">
            <li>
              <b>Salto del Faro</b><br>
              Marco jumps from the cliff full of excitement the day after his birthday. He feels excited, but also insecure about how this trip is going to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Auks In The Sky</b><br>
              Marco watches the birds flying in the sky around him as he starts sailing. He gets scared, thinking it might be some kind of signal. The water is colder than he expected; freezing temperatures touch his skin, and his neoprene suit is not properly closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sublimacja</b><br>
              Marco remembers one of the reasons for his trip. Coming from the destroyed world of Alsayfa, where he was heartbroken and had no control over his body or mind, he fell into a spiral of hedonism, not caring about anything. That feeling is still present.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Małgorzata</b><br>
              The feeling Marco is experiencing during this trip still persists. He cannot hold it anymore. A figure appears and offers him a magic pill, which he decides to accept. Suddenly, navigation starts to rush. The storm, the waves, and his racing heart make Marco happier than he has ever been.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Neopreno</b><br>
              After the effects of this frenetic night, Marco wakes up in the darkness of the ocean. His emotions have vanished; he cannot feel anything anymore. He does not know where he belongs. He misses the world he is leaving behind, but his mind does not allow him to feel excited about what is to come. At the end of the song, he submerges into the water. He sees lights heading north and decides to follow them. When he arrives, he finds the mysterious figure from before.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Habibi Riddim</b><br>
              This figure, in the shape of a siren, captures Marco’s heart. She helps him, and she is looking for him because of her magical powers, which make Marco feel so good. Suddenly, she changes her form into a demonic being. “Dámelo, dámelo,” she whispers at the end of the song, revealing that she only wanted to steal Marco’s soul.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>La capo</b><br>
              Marco is devastated. He does not have the energy to continue this trip. He keeps remembering how good she made him feel, crying over how perfect they looked together—a feeling that will never come back. He keeps sailing, crying harder and harder, and decides that he will try to find her again.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Miss Puffer Fish</b><br>
              Marco keeps sailing. It seems that the world is not treating him decently, so he remains unmotivated and fatigued. Then, another character approaches him during his journey: a small puffer fish. As it gets closer, Marco can see magical lights inside it. He knows it is dangerous, but at the same time, he feels that he could get energy from that creature. So he follows the fish.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Anemona</b><br>
              Marco keeps sailing. He is full of energy, but happiness is still missing inside him. He feels regret after killing the puffer fish. He promises himself that he will never do it again. What happened that day should not be revealed to anyone in the new universe. It was his last sin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Apnea</b><br>
              On a January morning, Marco starts swimming opposite to the sky, deeper and deeper into the ocean. His ears are blocked, but he can hear all the calming sounds around him: animal creatures, waves, currents. Eventually, there comes a moment when it is too late to return to the surface, so he accepts his fate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>209</b><br>
              Darkness surrounds Marco, and his heart starts racing. He begins to see lights in the deep sea. Many creatures approach him. “Are they real? Am I dead?” he asks himself. All these creatures swim around him, dancing and lighting up the obscure deep sea with colorful lights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cyclope</b><br>
              Marco accepts his fate.
            </li>
          </ol>
